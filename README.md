- **Deployed URL** - [DEFENDX-On-Device AI based Multi-Agent System for Behavior-Based Anomaly & Fraud Detection ](https://defendx.streamlit.app/))

### Project Artefacts

- **Technical Documentation** - Complete documentation in this Docs Folder
- **Source Code** - [app.py](app.py) and supporting files in the SRC Folder 
- **Models Used** - Isolation Forest (scikit-learn), One-Class SVM (scikit-learn) for behavioral anomaly detection
- **Models Published** - Local on-device model training with joblib persistence (privacy-preserving)
- **Datasets Used** - Real-time keystroke dynamics data generated through user interaction (real-time behavioral data)
- **Datasets Published** - Privacy-preserving behavioral biometric data generated in real-time

### Attribution

This project is an original implementation of behavior-based fraud detection using keystroke dynamics and multi-agent architecture. No existing open-source projects were used as a base. All code and algorithms are developed from scratch focusing on privacy-first, on-device processing.
