## Contributing Guidelines

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that follow this pattern:
- `feature/description` - For new features
- `bugfix/description` - For bug fixes
- `security/description` - For security improvements
- `docs/description` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - For code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add real-time anomaly detection alerts

- Implement real-time alert system for fraud detection
- Add notification components to UI
- Include configurable alert thresholds
- Update documentation for new feature

Closes #123
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `security:` - Security improvements

### Code Style

**Python Code Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include type hints where possible
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes

**Example:**
```python
def extract_behavioral_features(
    keystroke_data: List[Dict], 
    reference_text: str
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Extract behavioral features from keystroke timing data.
    
    Args:
        keystroke_data: List of keystroke events with timestamps
        reference_text: The reference text being typed
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing extracted behavioral features
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If keystroke_data is empty or invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

- Include detailed description and reproduction steps
- Allow time for assessment and fix before disclosure

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

**Required standards:**
- All functions must have docstrings
- Type hints for function parameters and returns
- Error handling for edge cases
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Multi-Agent Architecture

When contributing to the agent system, maintain:
- **KeystrokeAgent**: Keystroke capture and analysis
- **BehaviorModelAgent**: ML model training and prediction
- **FraudDetectionAgent**: Threat analysis and alerting
- **DataManagerAgent**: Data persistence and management

### Security Standards

**Security considerations:**
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Secure file handling practices
- Privacy protection for user data
- Local processing only (no external APIs)

## Current Architecture

The DefendX system is implemented as a single Streamlit application (`src/app.py`) with:
- **2743 lines** of integrated code
- **Four agent classes** for specialized functionality
- **Theme system** with light/dark modes and accessibility features
- **Professional UI** with multiple pages and real-time analytics
- **Local data storage** using CSV and JSON formats

## Getting Help

### Communication Channels

**For development questions:**
- Create GitHub discussions for general questions
- Use issues for specific problems
- Join community chat (if available)
